# Debounce Fix Applied - Summary

## 🚨 Issue Identified

**ReferenceError: debounce is not defined** at line 616 in `SellerDataContext.tsx`

## 🔧 Fix Applied

### Missing Import
- **Problem**: The `debounce` function was being used but not imported
- **Solution**: Added `import { debounce } from '../utils/debounce';` to the imports
- **File**: `frontend/src/contexts/SellerDataContext.tsx`

## ✅ Current Status

1. **Debounce Error**: ✅ FIXED - Import added
2. **React Hooks Ordering**: ✅ FIXED - Functions properly ordered
3. **Error Boundary**: ✅ WORKING - App no longer crashes completely
4. **Rate Limiting**: ⚠️ PARTIALLY FIXED - Still hitting limits on some endpoints

## 🔍 Remaining Issues

### Rate Limiting Still Active
The logs show that the app is still hitting rate limits on:
- `/api/notifications` - 429 (Too Many Requests)
- `/api/auth/me` - 429 (Too Many Requests)

This suggests that either:
1. The backend server hasn't been restarted yet
2. The rate limiting configuration changes haven't been fully applied
3. There are other endpoints still using the old rate limiting

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Restart Backend Server**: The rate limiting changes require a server restart
2. **Test the Application**: Verify that the debounce error is resolved
3. **Monitor Rate Limiting**: Check if the refresh endpoint rate limiting is working

### Verification Steps:
1. **Check Console**: No more "debounce is not defined" errors
2. **Error Boundary**: Should show error UI instead of crashing
3. **Rate Limiting**: Refresh endpoint should use dedicated rate limiter (200 requests per 15 minutes)

## 📋 Files Modified in This Fix

1. **`frontend/src/contexts/SellerDataContext.tsx`**
   - Added `import { debounce } from '../utils/debounce';`

## 🔍 What to Monitor

1. **Console Errors**: Should see no more debounce reference errors
2. **Error Boundary**: Should catch and display errors gracefully
3. **Rate Limiting**: Monitor for 429 errors on different endpoints
4. **Authentication**: Check if token refresh works without rate limiting

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Backend Restart Still Required**: Rate limiting fixes need server restart
- **Error Boundary Working**: App will now show error UI instead of crashing
- **Debounce Function**: Now properly imported and available for use

## 🧪 Testing

1. **Refresh the page** to test the debounce fix
2. **Check console** for any remaining errors
3. **Verify error boundary** catches errors gracefully
4. **Test rate limiting** after backend restart
